# Game of Life

See a live version at https://westwood846.github.io/game-of-life/

This is a implementation of Conway's Game of Life using React.js and Redux. The cell automation can be paused/resumed, cleared, randomized, sped up/down and ultimately manipulated by placing live cells with the mouse.

## Running

`npm start` runs the project in a dev server and opens the browser. `npm run deploy` pushes a production build of the game to the `gh-pages` branch of the `origin` remote.
